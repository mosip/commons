# TokenID Generator

#### Background

A Token ID can be requested by an Indivudual against his UIN. A library should be able to generate an unique ID and assign it against a UIN. When a request comes to retrieve a Token ID agains UIN, the system should return a mapping, if already exists. Otherwise, a mapping should be created and returned.  

#### Solution



**The key solution considerations are**


- The API will generate a unique number against the configurations. 

- The configurations are injected by the caller of the module. These configurations are defined in the config server.
