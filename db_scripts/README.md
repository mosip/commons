# Databases

## Overview
This folder contains various SQL scripts to create databases and tables in postgres. The tables are described under ```<db name>/ddl/```.The default data which is populated in the tables is present under ```<db name>/dml``` folder. 

These scripts are automatically run as part of DB initialisation in [Sandbox Deployment](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/deployment/sandbox-deployment) 

Developers may run the SQLs using ```<db name>/deploy.sh``` script.
